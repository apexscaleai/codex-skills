# Modern UI/UX Checklist (Next.js + React Native)

Use this checklist to make UI feel intentional and modern. Mark items PASS/FAIL/UNKNOWN and cite evidence or explain deviations.

## Typography (Hierarchy)

- Clear hierarchy (H1/H2/body/caption) exists (PASS/FAIL/UNKNOWN):
- Line lengths readable on web (avoid ultra-wide text blocks) (PASS/FAIL/UNKNOWN):
- Font weights used purposefully (avoid everything medium) (PASS/FAIL/UNKNOWN):
- Dynamic type supported on mobile (PASS/FAIL/UNKNOWN):

## Spacing (Rhythm)

- Consistent spacing scale (tokens or a small set of values) (PASS/FAIL/UNKNOWN):
- Layout uses rhythm (sections breathe; not cramped) (PASS/FAIL/UNKNOWN):
- Touch targets meet minimum sizes on mobile (PASS/FAIL/UNKNOWN):

## Color (Discipline)

- Colors come from tokens/theme (PASS/FAIL/UNKNOWN):
- Contrast is sufficient for text and UI states (PASS/FAIL/UNKNOWN):
- “One accent color” rule holds (avoid rainbow UI) (PASS/FAIL/UNKNOWN):

## Components (Consistency)

- Buttons have consistent variants (primary/secondary/ghost/destructive) (PASS/FAIL/UNKNOWN):
- Inputs have consistent states (default/focus/error/disabled) (PASS/FAIL/UNKNOWN):
- Loading/empty/error states follow a consistent pattern (PASS/FAIL/UNKNOWN):

## Motion (Meaningful, Restrained)

- Motion communicates state (loading, transitions), not decoration only (PASS/FAIL/UNKNOWN):
- Reduced motion supported where appropriate (PASS/FAIL/UNKNOWN):

## Layout (Structure)

- Web layouts use consistent grid/max-width strategy (PASS/FAIL/UNKNOWN):
- RN screens respect safe areas and avoid clipped content (PASS/FAIL/UNKNOWN):
- Visual density is appropriate (not “admin dashboard” for consumer UI) (PASS/FAIL/UNKNOWN):

## Copy & Feedback

- Error messages are specific and actionable (PASS/FAIL/UNKNOWN):
- Success feedback is clear but not noisy (PASS/FAIL/UNKNOWN):
